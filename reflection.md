What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

This assignment was quite difficult given my lack of retention on information from CSC110 last semester. Office hours proved to be very helpful in understanding some of the basics in the resale shop. The computer.py file was not hard for me to create given the video at the beginning of the assignment as well as understanding some of the processes laid out on the board during class time. I think that for next time, I will be attending office hours for the assignment, and would also recommend someone else to take advantage of this time. The assignment wasn't as tricky when "zooming out" and just trying to understand what the coding was trying to do. 


Making the computer before the resale shop was something that definitely worked for me in organizing and understanding all the components of the coding for the main file to run properly. In this entire assignment I never received an error code, things would just not print. Which although sounds good wasn't great in problem solving what was missing and why. 


What didn't work was just trying to do this on my own and trying to puzzle my way through it. I needed to think with more clarity of "dimensions" whether the coding was asking for something more specific or a generalization. In this instance a computer vs the entire system itself. Update price has been the one thing that has made me really stuck.
